# Whatsapp Custom Messages

_**(Under Development)**_

Although Whatsapp has a broadcast feature to send a certain message to all contacts in a broadcast list, these messages almost always feels impersonal and dull.

This tool allows you to add placeholders to any broadcast message you wish to send, making it more personal. This is especially useful in special occasions like Eid or Ramadan, where you want to send well-wishing to many people at once. 

Example: `Hello [Name], I wish you a happy [Occasion]!`
